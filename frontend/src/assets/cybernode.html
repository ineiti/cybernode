<h1>Welcome to CyberNode</h1>
<img src="/logo.png" style="float: left; margin: 5px; padding: 1em;" />
<p>Share your harddisk, bandwidth, and CPU and decide with whom you want to share.</p>
<p>This is a proof-of-concept of a decentralized sharing system, which merges torrent,
    tor, ipfs, and a reputation system.</p>
<p>This implementation is a centralized version to test out the frontend of the application.
    The actual decentralized version where the browser is an active node is being developed
    here: <a href="https://github.com/ineiti/fledger">Fledger</a> with a simple demonstrator
    here: <a href="https://web.fledg.re">Web demo</a>.
</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="/about.html">about page</a> with more information.</p>
<p>With the current version of CyberNode you can do the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Participate in the (simulated) network and see the other nodes (test and real ones)</li>
    <li>Visit webpages on the decentralized system</li>
    <li>Get Mana (tokens) while you're connected and more while you share other webpages</li>
    <li>Use the tokens to store a webpage in the network</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the possible next steps are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pages owned by users:<ul>
        <li>Upload by drag-and-dropping (should support at least Hugo pages)</li>
        <li>Simple built-in web editor</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Create a chat which is linked to a matrix room</li>
    <li>Start merging with fledger: instead of simulating the nodes in a central server,
        the nodes would be really done by the browser (or server)
    </li>
    <li>Add a reputation system where you can up/downvote other people's webpages, to define
        which ones you're OK of hosting and which ones you prefer to not host.
    </li>
</ul>
